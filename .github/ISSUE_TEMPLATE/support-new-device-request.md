# Required information

- Device vendor and model ->
- Device codename (if known) -> 
- LineageOS device tree -> _link_(*)
- Supported by DivestOS already? -> Yes/No
- I am willing to provide logs (requires either Matrix or Telegram) -> Yes/No (your request will likely get rejected if you select "No" here)

# Note

_Currently not supported devices might get added but this won't work without your help. That means you have to admit to test new builds and maybe provide logs if something is not working as expected._

_(*)your request will likely get rejected if there is no official LOS reference_
