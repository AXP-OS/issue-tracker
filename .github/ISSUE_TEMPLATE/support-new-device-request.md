# Required information

- Device vendor and model -> 
- LineageOS device tree -> _link_(*)
- Supported by DivestOS already? -> Yes/No
- I am willing to support (requires either Matrix or Telegram) -> 

# Note

_Currently not supported devices might get added but this won't work without your help. That means you have to admit to test new builds and maybe provide logs if something is not working as expected._

_(*)your request will likely get rejected if there is no official LOS reference_
